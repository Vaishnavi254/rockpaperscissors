# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Game! This is a simple game where the user plays against the computer. The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then compares both choices and displays the result: Win, Lose, or Draw.
